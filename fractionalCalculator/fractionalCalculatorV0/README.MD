supported opperating systems are windows 32 bit and windows 64 bit

The equation must be in the form of two fractions with the operator between them
if the equation uses just a integer it must be provided in the form number/1

Supported arithmetic: addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, division /
the values may be negative and the answer can also be negative

Each time you enter a valid equation it is stored to the history, the history only takes up to 18 equations
